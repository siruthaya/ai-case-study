# AI CASE STUDY
# Genesis Therapeutics
## Overview and Origin

# Genesis Therapeutics
Genesis Therapeutics, is pioneering generative and predictive AI technologies to develop and commercialize breakthrough treatments for patients suffering from severe and devastating conditions.

a company pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to create breakthrough medicines for patients with severe diseases, announced today that it has closed an oversubscribed $200 million round of Series B financing. The fresh capital will enable Genesis to evolve into a clinical stage company, further invest in its state-of-the-art AI platform, and ambitiously expand its discovery pipeline.
* When was the company incorporated?
Founded in 2019 and headquartered in Burlingame, California
* Who are the founders of the company?

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
 The idea for Genesis Therapeutics originated from AI research conducted at Stanford University
•	The company originated from Feinberg's Ph.D. research on AI and biophysics at Stanford University's Pande Lab.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Genesis has raised over $280M in funding from top technology and biotech investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Rock Springs Capital, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Radical Ventures, NVentures (NVIDIA's VC arm), BlackRock, and Menlo Ventures. The company has leveraged GEMS to build an internal pipeline with multiple programs against high-value targets, including data-poor and canonically undruggable targets where GEMS is uniquely advantaged. In addition, Genesis has two AI platform collaborations across a range of therapeutic areas: Eli Lilly
## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
we've continued to pioneer state-of-the-art innovation in generative and predictive AI for small molecule drug discovery. Key proprietary innovations within our GEMS AI platform include Dynamic PotentialNet and our molecular generation engine. Dynamic PotentialNet integrates deep learning and molecular simulations to enable field-leading prediction of potency, selectivity, and ADMET. Our molecular generation engine allows Genesis scientists to search immense swaths of chemical space and offers significant advantages in addressing challenging and previously undruggable targets.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Most of these companies are focused on B2B and support the large coporations. I would adivse them to open up channels for individuals and specially the marigilized to get support directly.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  The direct support to people and the society in genaral will bring more confidence in people to try their product.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  It doesn't require any special technologies and infrasturcre instead the company just have to expand to individuals.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
*   THe existing technologies will support the new idea with small increase in support personel.
