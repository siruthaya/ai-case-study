# AI CASE STUDY
## Genesis Therapeutics
### Overview and Origin

### Genesis Therapeutics
**Genesis Therapeutics**, is pioneering generative and predictive AI technologies to develop and commercialize breakthrough treatments for patients suffering from severe and devastating conditions. Genesis has created the industry's most advanced molecular AI platform – **GEMS** – which integrates deep learning and molecular simulations for property prediction, and language models for molecular generation. 
Thecompany was found in 2019 by Evan Feinberg - Founder and CEO and headquartered in Burlingame, California.  The idea for Genesis Therapeutics originated from AI research conducted at Stanford University. The company originated from **Feinberg's** Ph.D.  on AI and biophysics at Stanford University's Pande Lab.
Genesis has raised over $280M in funding from top technology and biotech investors.
## Business Activities
The company has leveraged GEMS to build an internal pipeline with multiple programs against high-value targets, including data-poor and canonically undruggable targets where GEMS is uniquely advantaged. In addition, Genesis has two AI platform collaborations across a range of therapeutic areas.
we've continued to pioneer state-of-the-art innovation in generative and predictive AI for small molecule drug discovery. Key proprietary innovations within our GEMS AI platform include Dynamic PotentialNet and our molecular generation engine. Dynamic PotentialNet integrates deep learning and molecular simulations to enable field-leading prediction of potency, selectivity, and ADMET. Our molecular generation engine allows Genesis scientists to search immense swaths of chemical space and offers significant advantages in addressing challenging and previously undruggable targets.
Some of their major customers include , **including Andreessen Horowitz, Rock Springs Capital, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Radical Ventures, NVentures (NVIDIA's VC arm) BlackRock, and Menlo Ventures**. These marketshare is so huge they were able to raise $280M from funding so easily.
Provides AI-driven drug discovery services to other biotech and pharmaceutical companies. The company operates on a business-to-business (B2B) model, providing AI-driven drug discovery services to other companies in the pharmaceutical industry. The founder was part of the research with university, he had a very big adantage from the get go.

The company Uses *3D spatial graph modeling and advanced molecular simulationx* focuses on exploring untapped chemical spaces and novel protein targets
as well as Accelerates hit identification through lead optimization and candidate selection. Integrates *deep learning-based predictive models, molecular simulations, and molecular generative AI*.

## Landscape
Gensis Therapeutics in field of Pharmacutical industry specilizes in Deep Learning, Drug Discovery, Artificial Intelligence, and Drug Development
The major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 to 1o years have been Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning. AI is being used to accelerate drug discovery and development processes, Applications include identifying drug targets, optimizing drug combinations, and improving manufacturing efficiency as well AI is enhancing data analytics capabilities for better decision-making. There is  been quite big focus on developing treatments tailored to specific patient groups based on genetic profiles.
The following are few major competitors in the same field.
  1. Variational AI : Healthcare company using AI to develop new small-molecule drugs
  2. Biomatter (formerly Biomatter Designs) :Synthetic biology company creating new proteins for health and sustainable manufacturing
  3. Cradle : Operates at the intersection of biology and AI Offers a platform for biologists to design improved proteins quickly
  4. Aqemia : Pharma tech company transforming drug discovery Uses quantum-inspired physics and machine learning to scale drug discovery
  5. Insilico Medicine: Clinical-stage biotech company in pharmaceutical R&D Offers novel target discovery, molecular structure generation, and clinical trial analysis

## Results
There has been huge business impcat and this company is able to generate huge funding from various top and big pharma compaies. Though the metrics that they use is not publically visible but its evident that the following metrics used like The time taken to discover a drug and its efficiency, accuracy  and usage effectivness and they have been very sucessfull on those metric creteria. Genesis Therapeutics named as Outperformer among 15 other companies, including Recursion, Exscientia, and Insilico Medicine.

## Recommendations
Most of these companies are focused on B2B and support the large coporations. I would adivse them to open up channels for individuals and specially the marigilized to get support directly.Though this idea has been implemented by many companies but its not widely employed and they should expand it. The direct support to people and the society in genaral will bring more confidence in people to try their product. It doesn't require any special technologies and infrasturcre instead the company just have to expand to individuals.THe existing technologies will support the new idea with small increase in support personel.
